1. If I am collaborating with a classmate, the first thing is to add the other person as a collaborator and have them accept the request. This is important so both people are on the same repository and are then able to create their seperate branches.

2. Developers use branches to create changes without directly affecting main.

3. Git is an open-source control system. Github is a Git repository hosting service, making it more accesible for users to use Git. These two systems work together by letting Github act as a user-friendly interface where it's easier to use Git.

4. In the command sequence, ` git add . ` should be the first step; the first two commands in the sequence should be swapped to look like :

` git add . `

` git commit -m "saving work" `

` git push `
